# todo-list

Developed a simple and user-friendly To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows 
users to input tasks, and upon clicking 'Add Task,' the tasks are dynamically added to the list below. The clean and 
responsive design ensures an optimal user experience, and the code demonstrates my proficiency in front-end web 
development, including event handling and DOM manipulation. The application effectively manages tasks with a 
minimalistic and visually appealing interface
